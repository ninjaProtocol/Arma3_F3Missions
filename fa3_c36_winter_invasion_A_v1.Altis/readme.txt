07. NOTES
=========

Consider turning of NVG equipment in addition to thermals for INDFOR vehicles or statics, in case they're too OP.

Helicopter AI at the start *may* misbehave inexplicably, and buck around. Please avoid feeling sick, consume
Party issued medicine.

All changelogs are for vX (where X={1,2,3...}) releases, not minor day-to-day work between. For my sanity.
