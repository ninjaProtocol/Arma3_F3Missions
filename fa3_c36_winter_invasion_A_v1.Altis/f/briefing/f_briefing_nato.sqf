<marker name = 'mrkSelakano'>Selakano</marker> and <marker name = 'mrkFeres'>Feres</marker> are abandoned save for AAF troops, thus large ordinance is allowed.

Should you capture AAF supply crates, refrain from using equipment you're not trained for, Comrades!

// NOTES: MISSION
// The code below creates the mission sub-section of notes.

_mis = player createDiaryRecord ["diary", ["Mission","
<br/>
As the platoon is spearheading the invasion, it must take out and capture key components of the AAF defence.
<br/><br/>
An <marker name = 'mrkAAA'>AAA Unit</marker> has been spotted in a clump of trees on a ridge near the southern tip. 
Neutralise it so that our helicopters can bring in troops and supplies from Stratis, and provide CAS support.
<br/><br/>
To enable proper air logistics, capture the small <marker name = 'mrkAir'>airbase</marker>. This will serve as HQ and enable a full invasion.
<br/><br/>
On your way to the airbase, you will encounter an <marker name = 'mrkBase'>AAF fortification</marker>. Clear it so that we may occupy it later.
<br/><br/>
Finally, the towns of <marker name = 'mrkSelakano'>Selakano</marker> and <marker name = 'mrkFeres'>Feres</marker> are abandoned, and only light AAF patrols are expected there. 
They are not among your objectives, but be careful in or around them.
