07. NOTES
=========

Currently the countdown trigger fires if bluefor was ever in the target area, after 15 mins.
i.e. I'm using a countown instead of a timeout. This was done to avoid accidently resetting the 
timer if palyers left the area (while fighting back, etc.). Ideally, one would want to pause the timer,
but that would involve scripts and I'm not in the mood for any more.

All changelogs are for vX (where X={1,2,3...}) releases or bugfixes, not minor day-to-day work in-between. For my sanity.
